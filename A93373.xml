            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The doſein ſubſtance, for middle age is 1 ſcruple, or not under 2 ſcruples, nor above 1 dram and half be adminiſtred. It is given beſt in the Spring and Fall; for in Summer the hear, in the Winter the cold hinders. Let it be taken faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and after that, let the Patient walk one hour or two; if the party be weak, walking may be omitted. Let him dine four hours after. At firſt let it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every third day, and afterward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day. Some the firſt days caſt it off
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170176:10"/> again: but ſometimes it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently given to 30 days. We muſt ſee that the ſteel paſſe thorough the Belly, which is known by the black Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and if it come not ſo, every 4. day we muſt purge with pills, or Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. After the tenth day, purge gently, and abſtain two days from the uſe of it. That it may deſcend the ſooner, you may add purgations to it &amp; correctors, &amp; give it in pills, 2. The Patient may go to the ſharp waters and hot baths, they that drink of them purge forth black excrements by reaſon of the vitrials. The ſowre waters called <hi>Swalbacenſes, Griesbachienſes, Egranae,</hi> the hot Baths of <hi>Baden, Carolius.</hi> Alſo medicaments made of Tartar.</p>
               <p>2. The weak parts muſt be corrected and ſtrengthned by internal and topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal means: ſo a cold ſtomack by inward heats, a hot liver by topicals, or by coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Clyſters, or give the pulp of the citron with the ſhell for ſo it will long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtay in the ſtomack, or whole grains of pepper. Or to a man that is long faſting give ſome Cooler, which will preſently go to the Liver, eſpecially if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170176:10"/> he do not exerciſe moderately, or give ſuch heats that are below the heat of the Liver, and which for that do not increaſe its diſtemper, as Egrimony Fumitory, Succory. So the ſtomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrengthned, you may ſafely give cool things that concern the Liver; or give ſuch things to drink, the mixture whereof is not diſcovered by a new and firſt concoction, but by the ſecond and third, as Spirit of Vitriol.</p>

Revulſions muſt be applied: as if there be plethory, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſtrength, a vein muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, of the ſame ſide, or if the hand be ill, in the oppoſite hand, by cupping glaſſes with ſcarification, blood-ſuckers by chaſings, ligatures. 2. Means to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate. After that, give one purgative at the beginning, before meat, whilſt the forces ſtand, of ſuch things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſtrong. Whilſt the purge worketh, the foot, or part affected, muſt be laid higher, or muſt be guarded with defenſatives. Vomits are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Then diaphoreticks at firſt, and colder diureticks, as Harts-horn, and the root of the Clot burr 3. Topicals that are Anodyns. <hi>Foreſtus</hi> praiſeth Duck-weed and flowers of Camomill with Barley meal boyld in milk, that they are wonderful good. <hi>Spiegelius</hi> commends the diſtilled water of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170176:17"/> roots and flowers of Meedſweet. Fat things are hurtful, we muſt often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Narcoticks. See <hi>Aph. 25. ſ.</hi> 5. Firſt uſe reſolvers and moderately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecuſſives, of Plaintain, Frog-ſpawn water, Houſleeke, Purſlane, Roſes, with moderate reſolvers in any form; but the repellers muſt be cold and moyſt. Reſolvers are the water of the flowers and leaves of Mullens, Earth-worms, decoction of Mugwort roots in ſea (or ſalt) water. <hi>Spiegetius</hi> commends the Urine of men, ſalt of Urine, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſalt tempered with water of Meede-ſweet, anointed on the part with a feather. The liquor of Snails re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with ſalt in a copper veſſel, or boyld in vinegar and oyl of Roſes. Reſolving ſuffumes are profitable: Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons dung boyld in vinegar is good, and nettles boyld in wine.</p>
               <p>Hard humours are cured with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cataplaſmes of old cheeſe, juyce of Tobacco, and by Fumes. Rotten cheeſe with the broth of a gammon of bacon, <hi>Scal.</hi> addeth the powder of a fire-ſtone burnt. See <hi>Senn.</hi> concerning <hi>Arthritis.</hi> Storks-dung boyled in Hogs-greaſe.

               <p>The Phyſitian is oft times deceived thinking the cauſe to be hor. 1. If he ſay, He is helped with hot means therefore it is cold, whereas by opening the pores hot things may be cooled. 2. The pain is aſſwaged by cold things, therefore it is hot; becauſe cold things take away the ſenſe, but not the cauſe. 3. The pain is intenſe, therefore it is hot; ſince cold things by a malignant poyſon can do the ſame. 4 The colour is yellow, therefore it comes of choler, becauſe much fleam is died with a very little choler. 5. There is a Fever and fiery coloured Urine, therefore: but by reaſon of watchings and pain, a Feaver may ariſe. <hi>Pareus l. 17. Rulandus</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>
                  <hi>Preſervation</hi> is made by diet: dunghil cocks and capons muſt be avoided, for they are gouty by eating ſand. <hi>Senn.</hi> Fat things muſt be eſchewed, and things that are fried; all muſt be ſeaſoned with Mugwort, as it is wont to be done, and Parſley. To ride and walk overmuch is very hurtful. The feet muſt be put into new hot liquor of grapes preſt out. Some every moneth open a vein in the great toes, or the feet: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, every month before the ful moon, ſet cupping glaſſes to the ſoles of the feet; without ſcarification one may purge. Medicaments againſt the Gowt are profitable, which ſee in <hi>Senn.</hi> The joynts muſt be ſtrengthened many wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſtion.</hi> What is the cauſe? <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſaith, that the antecedent cauſe is without the Scull: 1. Becauſe many Veins end there, and there is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the head. 2. Becauſe the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170176:18"/> gathered in the brain is purged, forth by the noſtrils &amp; the palate. <hi>Laur.</hi> and <hi>Senn.</hi> argue againſt this; But ſhould it be collected within the ſcull, and ſhould run from thence by the palate, alwaies nauſeating, vomiting, a cough ſhould go before Arthritis. If it come from the Heart or Liver, bubo's in the groins and arm-holes, ſhould go before it; for there are properly the emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> will have the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, not by the veſſels but under the skin: <hi>Laur.</hi> denieth it. 1. Becauſe Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers end in Arthritis, whoſe cauſes are in the veins. 2. It is often cured by opening a vein. 3. Becauſe before the paroxyſme, the veins ſwell and are red. 4. It ſhould cauſe ſhivering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> will have fleam to be the cauſe: it is not blood, for that without the veſſels would corrupt, and putrefie; not melancholly, for that would go to a ſcirrhus, nor would it ſuddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us; not choler, for that would turn to matter: not ſalt fleam, for that would exulcerate.</p>
               <p>2. Whether every pain of the joynts
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170176:19"/> be Arthritis? I deny it: for ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jonting and pains of the pox, and pains of the hips in maids, and women in child-birth, alſo a humour bred by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the joynts ſhould be Arthritis, which is falſe; for as oedematous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is rather cauſed by it then Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis: ſo by the drying up of humours in the joynts there groweth pain in the joynts, <hi>Aph. 16. ſ.</hi> 3. yet not Arthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</p>

                  <hi>The Cauſe.</hi> It is a thin watery mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the humours, ſwelling and malignant. The parts affected are the Nerves: becauſe it is very luxuriant in the back and the loins, by reaſon of

                  <hi>The kinds.</hi> 1. It hath Tumors about the joynts, which if they laſt long they bring forth ſpots, as in the Scurvey, which ſometimes coming to ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are turned unto a malignant ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer: chiefly about the feet, whence worms like Cantharides are brought forth. Sometimes the whole matter ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon one part: whence the whole body is freed from pain, an Impoſtume groweth, which endeth in a <hi>Fiſtula.</hi>

               <p>The Impoſtume is broke with Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane and ſalt, beaten in a mortar, and applyed; the Impoſtume being broken

                  <hi>A Feaver</hi> called <hi>Elodes,</hi> of which few have ſpoken, is that wherein the Body is diſſolved by continual ſweating; for where there is long ſweating, the Body muſt needs be diſſolved.</p>

                  <hi>A Peſtilent Feaver</hi> differs from the Plague, by the vehemency of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and contagion, which is greater in the Plague. A malignant Feaver is yet leſſe dangerous, and few dye of it, none are infected by it. There are no Peſtilent Feavers of one day, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Continuals, and ſome Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, according to <hi>Pareus, L. de Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Signs diagnoſtick.</hi> In the beginning there is a greater weakneſſe of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then the nature of a Feaver, or heat do cauſe, a ſmall pulſe, urine like to thoſe that are ſound, and oft times alſo crude, and the face ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſleep or waking oppreſſe them, a <hi>deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Vertigo,</hi> Convulſion, Vomiting, Scowring; It is obſerved that bleeding at the Noſe in the beginning of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cure.</hi> Since two things do urge, either Malignity or the Feaver; If that urge, moſt Antidotes are neceſſary; if this, we muſt go about the cure of it; wherefore preſently give <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> as much as we can, temperate; for the matter admitteth not concoction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then a Vein may be opened; gentle Clyſters, and ſuch as bring forth the dung are uſeful; Vomiting is ſometimes good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then come again to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes. This following Electuary is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Take two Pome-citrons ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led well with Roſe water, and with Sugar what may ſweeten them; boyl that to the conſiſtence of an Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Spotted Feaver.</hi> The ſpot differs from Freckles, and other Puſhes, in a Feaver in greatneſſe; for they are not high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor long but round, like Flea bites; It differs from Flea bites, becauſe in Bites there appears a bite in the middle, which remaineth ſtill, though you drive
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170176:81"/> away the other redneſſe, by preſſing or rubbing it. Spots if they be preſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh but return; they are ſeldom in the face, by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of the Arteries, and the cold aire driving them back. They are without ulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pricking, or riſings-up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Signs Prognoſtick.</hi> If they come forth plentifully on a critical day, and there follow eaſe, it is good: but if when the matter is raw, as they often do, they are mortal. The few or many ſpots do not certainly ſhew life or death. They dye whoſe ſpots are black: they that have them ſeen in their face; they whoſe urine is ſtopt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cure.</hi> Firſt give a lenitive, open a Vein before the fourth day, but after the fourth forbear it. Give ſweating means. If a Flux of the Belly come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, ſtop it not unleſs it be too much, but leave the whole work to Nature. In the mean while uſe Alteratives and Corroboratives. Apply Theriac to the Heart and Pulſes with juyce of Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, oyl of Scorpions; and uſe an unction of Nitre, as before, by Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170176:81"/> the poyſoned vapours are fitly derived from the Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Hungary Feaver,</hi> or a diſeaſe of <hi>Hungary.</hi> It is a <hi>Peſtilent Feaver,</hi> and cometh neer to the <hi>Plague. Crato</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to putrid continual Feavers, <hi>Langius</hi> to a <hi>Cauſus;</hi> for the heat is extream: Others to a Spotted Feaver. Yet here, though ſometimes, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies there are not ſpots. It began in the year 1566.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cauſe. Rulandus</hi> and <hi>Jordanus</hi> ſay, There is the higheſt malignity, and the higheſt <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> and that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but they ſay, the <hi>Cacochymia</hi> comes from fleam. 1. Becauſe at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Purgers of fleam profit, but not opening a Vein. 2. It is more ſharp about night. 3. It is more violent when the South wind bloweth, and it ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in cloudy weather. 4. Becauſe there is pain of the ſtomach. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ends by ſweat and urine. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it laſts beyond ſeven or fourteen days. 7. Becauſe it often ends by an Apoſteme. <hi>Sennertus</hi> holds it to be <hi>Cauſus,</hi> yet ſo, that there is great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fleam, yet not as the cauſe of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Signs Diagnoſtick.</hi> An extream pain of the Head: the ſpitting moiſture of the Tongue is dried, and the Tongue becomes black by the black ſmoke of the blood: which effect is called, <hi>Die Breun,</hi> it cometh with ſhaking. As led by the Hand, they ſhew the pain of the ſtomach, and cannot endure to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched there; for it is hard. There is an unquenchable thirſt, and a <hi>delirium.</hi> They, almoſt all, fall into deaſneſſe, and ſwelling behind the Ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cure.</hi> If it come by contagion, giving a gentle remedy to bring forth the dung, give preſently an Antidote; but if there be pain of the ſtomach, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, heat, nauſeating, thoſe humours muſt firſt be taken away by purging or vomiting with Agarick, Senna leaves, <hi>Diaphaenicon Roſarum Meſves, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vomits here are often the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. The humours being voided, or if there were no ſuch, the firſt or ſecond day open a Vein, though the firſt day the ſpots ſhould appear, ſo there be ſtrength. Almoſt all who neglected bleeding at the firſt, died. If there be Vomiting or Scowring, it is more ſafely
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170176:82"/> let alone. Open the Liver or <hi>Medias</hi> of a Vein in the Foot, which is moſt commodious of all, chiefly in women. Alſo it may be done on the third day. After the third day, Vomits &amp; Purges; for opening a Vein is mortal. Cupping glaſſes inſtead of opening a Vein, may be ſet to the lower parts, then we muſt fight with Antidotes, yet with ſuch as do not increaſe the Feaver. One dram of <hi>Species liberantis,</hi> Bezar ſtone, Harts horne, flowers of Brimſtone, Amber, Zedoans, all things of a Pome-citron; The roots a part, and Bezar a part are all moſt effectual. Afterwards Diureticks may be given. The drink muſt be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wine nor beer; let it be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Harts-horn, with ſpirit of Vitriol: or Barly water with juyce of Lemmons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symptoms of Feavers.</hi> Pain of the Head is cured by general means, by To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picals. Many commend a Radiſh root cut in ſlices, and laid to the feet, firſt waſhed with Salt and Vinegar. Juyce of Houſleek, and Alces of <hi>America;</hi> For Houſleek on houſes is full of juyce in the greateſt heat, but flags in a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170176:83"/> aire; becauſe it draweth the dryer vapours for its nouriſhment. The root of Rhodia is commended, one ounce with Roſe water, half a pound; boyl them, &amp; apply the decoction with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth to the Head. The unguent of Alabaſter with <hi>Populeum</hi> muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted on the <hi>Coronal ſuture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Drineſs of the Tongue is cured with ſcraping of cuttle bone, and moyſtners that are of the ſtrongeſt, as with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or juyce of Houſleek, <hi>Sal prunella;</hi> ſpirit of Vitriol, Barley water.</p>
               <p>Thirſt if it be from heat of the Lungs, the Mouth is dry, they can hardly ſpeak; which cannot be quenched with drink, but it will preſently come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Here it is better to take in the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aire than to drink. It is good to hold cold water in the Mouth, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Cherries; Lettice leaves, Purſlane preſerved, or ſprinkled with cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Oxycratum, pieces of Pome-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, conſerves of Sorrel, pieces of Cucumbers, Gourds, firſt ſprinkled with Sugar, Cryſtal, Tamarinds, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, garden Currence to hold in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170176:83"/> Mouth; The decoction of the Roots of Sorrel, which will look like red Wine; Give drink in the vigour. If the cauſe be in the ſtomach, the humour muſt be voided, namely, that is hot and ſharp.</p>

That the bones reſtored may be kept ſo, by Medicaments of the white of an Egg, what is ſufficient, and Bole-Armenick, half an ounce: by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170176:88"/> forms made of linnen cloth three or four double, which fill up the hollow, as in the Ham, or make the ſlenderneſs of the part equal, as in the Wriſt; by Splints, which becauſe at this day we want, they are made of much paper, and thin Chips of Wood; yet ſoe that the Wood be not green. <hi>Fab. c. 4. obſ.</hi> 98. makes of ſoles of Shooes, of plates of white Lead or Iron: about the ends let them be alwaies thinner, and where they lye upon the Fracture, let them be thicker, by wiſpes or wreaths made of ſmall ſticks, about a finger thick, wrapt up in linnen. For a Fracture of the Leg or Thigh, two are laid on, from the Heel to the Groin, that by their ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they may hold the part unmoved; by boxes made of plates of Iron or Wood. The uſe of them is in the Bed, or when they are taken out of their bed; by Swaths, which are either of leather, as in a Fracture of the Noſe, or of wollen as in Inflammation, where there needs no Ligature, or linnen. Every part muſt be ſo bound as we would have it remain. If on the right ſide the Fracture be more eminent, or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170176:88"/> in the outſide; you muſt begin to ſwath on the outſide, and bind it harder on that ſide; but if in the inſide, now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days contrarily, the firſt band is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the part disjoynted or broken, and there they bind it faſt with thick rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings toward the Body. The ſecond band laid on they ſwathe with fewer rollings toward the extrem parts. The third is put upon the end of the part that is hurt, and is rolled gently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, cutting the rollings of the firſt and ſecond Swath-band croſs-wiſe, and reſtoreth the Muſcles removed by the firſt &amp; ſecond from their places. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they apply Splints. The binding being done, the ſick muſt be asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Limb be not too hard bound? If he ſay I, unbind it, and bind it looſer. Too looſe is unprofitable, too hard cauſeth defluxion. It is a ſign of right ſwathing, if the next day the part ſwell with a flegmatick Tumor. If the part ſwell hard, it is too ſtraight; if it ſwell not, it is to looſe; If it be too ſtraight, next day bind it more looſe; Foment the part with water and oyl: otherwiſe before the fourth day nothing muſt he

From the third to the ſeventh the part groweth ſmaller; wherefore on the ſeventh day it muſt be bound cloſer then before, becauſe there is no more fear of Symptoms. If it be a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fracture, wet the bands and plagers in Oxycratum, or in red wine, if it be with a Wound.

If there be a Feaver, we muſt give cold things, as juyce of Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Pomegranates, Oranges, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Harts-horn, Bezar, a Clyſter of Milk. Apply bitter things outwardly. <hi>Heurnius</hi> commendeth this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth for Children.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Cauſe</hi> immediate, is a tanateous humour, bred from concoction hurt, either of it ſelf, or by outward error: a watery blood oft times mingled with other things; if it become malignant, is the next cauſe, if it be not already the antecedent cauſe, for it is malignant. It is generated by reaſon of concoction hurt, by things natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not natural, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural, and by the volatil ſalt that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170176:161"/> is in meats, and ventilation wanting. So <hi>Platerus</hi> determins, that meat and drink may become blood under the form of vapours. So it is cured by reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies full of volatil ſalt, as by Scurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſe, out of which, if either by length of time, or by boyling, the volatil ſalt ſhould exhale, they grow unprofitable. Wherefore juyce and conſerve are moſt profitable. So meats that breed the Scurvey, abound with fixed ſalt, to be cured by volatil; Vinegar makes for this, and meats hardned by ſmoke.</p>

The ſick ſay they are ſound: ſome on certain days with and without a Feaver are more afflicted. Some are boundin their Bellies, others looſe. The Feet are ſpotted, ſometimes they ſwell, are made leſſe. There are Ulcers on their Legs, a crooked melancholy vein under the Tongue. All ſymptoms of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malfaculty, Dropſy, Gangrene, oft times Scabs, a baſtard Plureſy, bleeding at the Noſe, bloody ſtools, opening of Veins in the Legs.

               <p>If the Ulcer be with a Tumor, eating not only the <hi>Cucula,</hi> but alſo the fleſh, it is called an eating-Ulcer.
